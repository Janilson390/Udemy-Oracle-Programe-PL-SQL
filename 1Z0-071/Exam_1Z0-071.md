# Question #1
Evaluate the following SQL statement:.  
(Avalie a seguinte instrução SQL).

~~~sql
SELECT cust_id, cust_last_name "Last name"
FROM customers
WHERE country_id = 10 
UNION 
SELECT cust_id CUST_NO, cust_last_name
FROM customers 
WHERE country_id = 30

>Using the ORDER BY Clause in Set Operations
> * The ORDER BY clause can appear only once at the end of the compound query.
> * Component queries cannot have individual ORDER BY clauses.
> * The ORDER BY clause recognizes only the columns of the first SELECT query.
> * By default, the first column of the first SELECT query is used to sort the output in an ascending order.
